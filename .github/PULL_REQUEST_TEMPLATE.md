<!-- ATTENTION!
1. Please write pull request readme in English, thanks!

2. Always remember that NexT includes 4 schemes. And if on one of them works fine after the changes, on another scheme this changes can be broken. Muse and Mist have similar structure, but Pisces is very difference from them. Gemini is a mirror of Pisces with some styles and layouts remakes. So, please make the tests at least on two schemes (Muse or Mist and Pisces or Gemini).

3. In addition, you need to confirm that the changes made by this PR are compatible with PJAX and Dark Mode.
