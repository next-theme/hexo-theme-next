<!-- ATTENTION!
1. Please write pull request readme in English, thanks!

2. NexT includes 4 schemes: Muse and Mist have similar structure, but Pisces and Gemini are very different from them. It is possible that one scheme works fine after the changes, but another scheme is broken. Please make the tests in different schemes to make sure the changes are compatible with all schemes.

3. In addition, you need to confirm that the changes made by this PR are compatible with PJAX and Dark Mode.
